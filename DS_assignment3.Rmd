#R Markdown PDF Challenge
This is my attempt at creating a pretty document in R Studio. I am sort of trying, but coding is very confusing. 

The following assignment is an exercise for the reproduction of this .html document using the RStudio and RMarkdown tools we’ve shown you in class. Hopefully by the end of this, you won’t feel at all the way this poor PhD student does. We’re here to help, and when it comes to R, the internet is a really valuable resource. This open-source program has all kinds of tutorials online.

*Here is a picture ~~I was forced to add~~ to distract you from my feeble attempts at coding:*

*And here is a comic I like a little bit more:*

**Both comics were taken from** [**PhD Comics.**](http://phdcomics.com)

##Challenge Goals

The goal of this R Markdown html challenge is to give you an opportunity to play with a bunch of different RMarkdown formatting. Consider it a chance to flex your RMarkdown muscles. Your goal is to write your own RMarkdown that rebuilds this html document as close to the original as possible. So, yes, this means you get to copy my irreverant tone exactly in your own Markdowns. It’s a little window into my psyche. Enjoy =)

**hint: go to the [PhD Comics website](http://phdcomics.com) to see if you can find the image above**
*If you can’t find that exact image, just find a comparable image from the PhD Comics website and include it in your markdown*

###I am not sure I am enjoying this assignment yet.

And my feelings deserve a whole separate section. You may even have noticed that this is under a **different** level header.

And since we are sharing comics, I want to make room for one more:

###Here's a header! Mathy header. 

Let’s be honest, this header is a little arbitrary. But show me that you can reproduce headers with different levels please. This is a level 3 header, for your reference (you can most easily tell this from the table of contents).

####Another header, now with maths

Perhaps you’re already really confused by the whole markdown thing. Maybe you’re so confused that you’ve forgotton how to add. Never fear! ~~A calculator~~ R is here:

I'm not sure why we are doing math, but:

```{r}
666+13131313131313134
```

**Wow, this worked!** I am shocked it^actually^ worked...

###Why I am taking this class:

```{r}
dat<- data.frame(t=seq(0, 2*pi, by=0.1) )
 xhrt <- function(t) 16*sin(t)^3
 yhrt <- function(t) 13*cos(t)-5*cos(2*t)-2*cos(3*t)-cos(4*t)
 dat$y=yhrt(dat$t)
 dat$x=xhrt(dat$t)
 with(dat, plot(x,y, type="l", xlab="Me", ylab="Bacteria"))
```

Is it bad that I took pretty codes from [somewhere?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8082429/plot-a-heart-in-r)

###Here is a table:

Or maybe, after you’ve added those numbers, you feel like it’s about time for a table!
I’m going to leave all the guts of the coding here so you can see how libraries (R packages) are loaded into R (more on that later). It’s not terribly pretty, but it hints at how R works and how you will use it in the future. The summary function used below is a nice data exploration function that you may use in the ^future^.
```{r}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars),caption="I made this table with kable in the knitr package library, but I'm not sure why")
```

###Here's another table:

Organism   | Level of coolness(%)
---------  |------------------
Human      | 0
Giraffe    | 75
Polar bear | 100
Prokaryote | 100


##The big finale.
