#R Markdown PDF Challenge
This is my attempt at creating a pretty document in R Studio. I am sort of trying, but coding is very confusing. 

*Here is a picture ~~I was forced to add~~ to distract you from my feeble attempts at coding:*

![**Some comic.**](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd011718s.gif){width=70%}

*And here is a comic I like a little bit more:*

![**A slightly more relatable comic...**](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd101609s.gif){width=70%}

**Both comics were taken from** [**PhD Comics.**](http://phdcomics.com)

###I am not sure I am enjoying this assignment yet.

And my feelings deserve a whole separate section. You may even have noticed that this is under a **different** level header.

And since we are sharing comics, I want to make room for one more:

##Mathy header. 

I'm not sure why we are doing math, but:

```{r}
666+13131313131313134
```

**Wow, this worked!** I am shocked it^actually^ worked...

###Why I am taking this class:

```{r}
dat<- data.frame(t=seq(0, 2*pi, by=0.1) )
 xhrt <- function(t) 16*sin(t)^3
 yhrt <- function(t) 13*cos(t)-5*cos(2*t)-2*cos(3*t)-cos(4*t)
 dat$y=yhrt(dat$t)
 dat$x=xhrt(dat$t)
 with(dat, plot(x,y, type="l", xlab="Me", ylab="Bacteria"))
```

Is it bad that I took pretty codes from [somewhere?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8082429/plot-a-heart-in-r)

##Here is a table:
```{r}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars),caption="I made this table with kable in the knitr package library, but I'm not sure why")
```

###Here's another table:

Organism   | Level of coolness(%)
---------  |------------------
Human      | 0
Giraffe    | 75
Polar bear | 100
Prokaryote | 100


##The big finale.
